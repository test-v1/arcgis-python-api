<dd><p>SolveVehicleRoutingProblem tool solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles.
A dispatcher managing a fleet of vehicles is often required to make decisions about vehicle routing. One such decision
involves how to best assign a group of customers to a fleet of vehicles and to sequence and schedule their visits. The
objectives in solving such vehicle routing problems (VRP) are to provide a high level of customer service by honoring
any time windows while keeping the overall operating and investment costs for each route as low as possible. The
constraints are to complete the routes with available resources and within the time limits imposed by driver work
shifts, driving speeds, and customer commitments. This method can be used to determine solutions for such complex
fleet management tasks. Consider an example of delivering goods to grocery stores from a central warehouse location.
A fleet of three trucks is available at the warehouse. The warehouse operates only within a certain time window-from
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.-during which all trucks must return back to the warehouse. Each truck has a capacity of 15,000
pounds, which limits the amount of goods it can carry. Each store has a demand for a specific amount of goods (
in pounds) that needs to be delivered, and each store has time windows that confine when deliveries should be made.
Furthermore, the driver can work only eight hours per day, requires a break for lunch, and is paid for the time spent
on driving and servicing the stores. The goal is to come up with an itinerary for each driver (or route) such that the
deliveries can be made while honoring all the service requirements and minimizing the total time spent on a particular
route by the driver.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>orders: Orders (FeatureSet). Required parameter.  Specify one or more orders (up to 2,000). These are the locations</dt>
<dd><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>that the routes of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) analysis</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div>should visit. An order can represent a delivery (for example,
furniture delivery), a pickup (such as an airport shuttle bus
picking up a passenger), or some type of service or inspection (a
tree trimming job or building inspection, for
instance).</div></blockquote>
<p>When specifying the orders, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using
attributes. The orders can be specified with the following attributes:
ObjectID: The system-managed ID field.
Name:  The name of the order. The name must be unique. If the</p>
<blockquote>
<div>name is left null, a name is automatically generated at solve
time.</div></blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>ServiceTime:  This property specifies how much time will be spent at the</dt>
<dd>network location when the route visits it; that is, it stores the
impedance value for the network location. A zero or null value
indicates the network location requires no service time.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.</dd>
<dt>TimeWindowStart1: The beginning</dt>
<dd><p class="first">time of the first time window for the
network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates no beginning time.</p>
<p>A time window only states when a vehicle can arrive
at an order; it doesn’t state when the service time must be
completed. To account for service time and leave before the time
window is over, subtract ServiceTime from the TimeWindowEnd1
field.</p>
<p class="last">The time window fields can contain a time-only value or a
date and time value. If a time field such as TimeWindowStart1 has a
time-only value (for example, 8:00 AM), the date is assumed to be
the date specified by the Default Date parameter. Using date and
time values (for example, 7/11/2010 8:00 AM) allows you to set time
windows that span multiple days.
When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each order’s time-window values refer to the time
zone in which the order is located.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TimeWindowEnd1: The ending time of the first window for the network</dt>
<dd>location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates no ending time.</dd>
<dt>TimeWindowStart2: The beginning time of the second time window for the</dt>
<dd><p class="first">network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates that there is no second time window.</p>
<p>If the first time window is null, as specified by
the TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1 fields, the second time
window must also be null.</p>
<p class="last">If both time windows are nonnull, they can’t
overlap. Also, the second time window must occur after the
first.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TimeWindowEnd2:  The ending time of the second time window for the</dt>
<dd><p class="first">network location. This field can contain a null
value.</p>
<p>When TimeWindowStart2 and TimeWindowEnd2 are both
null, there is no second time window.</p>
<p class="last">When TimeWindowStart2 is not null but TimeWindowEnd2
is null, there is a second time window that has a starting time but
no ending time. This is valid.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MaxViolationTime1: A time window is considered violated if the arrival</dt>
<dd><p class="first">time occurs after the time window has ended. This field specifies
the maximum allowable violation time for the first time window of
the order. It can contain a zero value but can’t contain negative
values. A zero value indicates that a time window violation at the
first time window of the order is unacceptable; that is, the first
time window is hard. On the other hand, a null value indicates that
there is no limit on the allowable violation time. A nonzero value
specifies the maximum amount of lateness; for example, a route can
arrive at an order up to 30 minutes beyond the end of its first
time window.</p>
<p>The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
Field Units parameter</p>
<p>Time window violations can be tracked and weighted by the
solver. Because of this, you can direct the VRP solver to take one
of three approaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Minimize the overall violation time, regardless of the
increase in travel cost for the fleet.</p>
<p>Find a solution that balances overall violation time and
travel cost.</p>
<p>Ignore the overall violation time; instead, minimize
the travel cost for the fleet.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">By assigning an importance level for the Time Window
Violation Importance parameter, you are essentially choosing one of
these three approaches. In any case, however, the solver will
return an error if the value set for MaxViolationTime1 is
surpassed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MaxViolationTime2: The maximum allowable violation time for the second</dt>
<dd>time window of the order. This field is analogous to the
MaxViolationTime1 field.</dd>
</dl>
<p>InboundArriveTime:
Defines when the item to be delivered to the order will be ready at the starting depot. The order can be assigned to a route only if the inbound arrive time precedes the route’s latest start time value; this way, the route cannot leave the depot before the item is ready to be loaded onto it. This field can help model scenarios involving inbound-wave transshipments. For example, a job at an order requires special materials that are not currently available at the depot. The materials are being shipped from another location and will arrive  at the depot at 11:00 a.m. To ensure a route that leaves before the shipment arrives isn’t assigned to the order, the order’s inbound arrive time is set to 11:00 a.m. The special materials arrive at 11:00 a.m., they are loaded onto the vehicle, and the vehicle departs from the depot to visit its assigned orders.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>Notes: The route’s start time, which includes service times, must occur after the inbound arrive time. If a route begins before an order’s inbound arrive time, the order cannot be assigned to the route. The assignment is invalid even if the route has a start-depot service time that lasts until after the inbound arrive time.</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div>This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and
time value. If a
time-only value is set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be
the date specified by the Default Date parameter.  The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in the Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes a date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">The VRP solver honors InboundArriveTime regardless of the DeliveryQuantities value. If an outbound depart time is also specified, its time value must occur after the inbound arrive time. OutboundDepartTime:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>Defines when the item to be picked up at the order must arrive at the ending depot. The order can be assigned to a route only if the route can visit the order and reach its end depot before the specified outbound depart time. This field can help model scenarios involving outbound-wave transshipments. For instance, a shipping company sends out delivery trucks to pick up packages from orders and bring them into a depot where they are forwarded on to other facilities, en route to their final destination.  At 3:00 p.m. every day, a semitrailer stops at the depot to pick up the high-priority packages and take them directly to a central processing station. To avoid delaying the high-priority packages until the next day’s 3:00 p.m. trip, the shipping company tries to have delivery trucks pick up the high-priority packages from orders and bring them to the depot before the 3:00 p.m. deadline. This is done by setting  the outbound depart time to 3:00 p.m.</dt>
<dd><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Notes: The route’s end time, including service times, must occur before the outbound depart time. If a route reaches a depot but doesn’t complete its end-depot service time prior to the order’s outbound depart time, the order cannot be assigned to the route.</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div>This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and
time value. If a
time-only value is set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be
the date specified by the Default Date parameter.  The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes a date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">The VRP solver honors OutboundDepartTime regardless of the PickupQuantities value. If an inbound arrive time is also specified, its time value must occur before the  outbound depart time. DeliveryQuantities: The size of the delivery. You can specify size in</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>any dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You
can even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and
volume.</p>
<p>Enter delivery quantities without indicating units.
For example, if a 300-pound object needs to be delivered to an
order, enter 300. You will need to remember that the value is in
pounds.</p>
<p>If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate
the numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording
the weight and volume of a delivery that weighs 2,000 pounds and
has a volume of 100 cubic feet, enter 2000 100. Again, you need to
remember the units-in this case, pounds and cubic feet. You also
need to remember the sequence in which the values and their corresponding
units are entered.</p>
<p>Make sure that Capacities for Routes and
DeliveryQuantities and PickupQuantities for Orders are specified in
the same manner; that is, the values need to be in the same units,
and if you are using multiple dimensions, the dimensions need to be
listed in the same sequence for all parameters. So if you specify
weight in pounds, followed by volume in cubic feet for
DeliveryQuantities, the capacity of your routes and the pickup
quantities of your orders need to be specified the same way: weight in
pounds, then volume in cubic feet. If you mix units or change the
sequence, you will get unwanted results without receiving any
warning messages.</p>
<p class="last">An empty string or null value is equivalent to all
dimensions being zero. If the string has an insufficient number of
values in relation to the capacity count, or dimensions being
tracked, the remaining values are treated as zeros. Delivery
quantities can’t be negative.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PickupQuantities: The size of the pickup. You can specify size in any</dt>
<dd><p class="first">dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You can
even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume.
You cannot, however, use negative values. This field is analogous
to the DeliveryQuantities field of Orders.</p>
<p class="last">In the case of an exchange visit, an order can have
both delivery and pickup quantities.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Revenue: The income generated if the order is included in a</dt>
<dd><p class="first">solution. This field can contain a null value-a null value
indicates zero revenue-but it can’t have a negative
value.</p>
<p class="last">Revenue is included in optimizing the objective
function value but is not part of the solution’s operating cost;
that is, the TotalCost field in the route class never includes
revenue in its output. However, revenue weights the relative
importance of servicing orders.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SpecialtyNames: A space-separated string containing the names of the</dt>
<dd><p class="first">specialties required by the order. A null value indicates that the
order doesn’t require specialties.</p>
<p>The spelling of any specialties listed in the Orders
and Routes classes must match exactly so that the VRP solver can
link them together.</p>
<p class="last">To illustrate what specialties are and how they
work, assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of
its orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The
company would enter BucketTruck in the SpecialtyNames field for
these orders to indicate their special need. SpecialtyNames would
be left as null for the other orders. Similarly, the company would
also enter BucketTruck in the SpecialtyNames field of routes that
are driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It would leave the field
null for the other routes. At solve time, the VRP solver assigns
orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns
orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have
them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>AssignmentRule: This field specifies the rule for assigning the order to a</dt>
<dd><p class="first">route. It is constrained by a domain of values, which are listed
below (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>0 (Exclude)-The order is to be excluded from the
subsequent solve operation.</p>
<p>1 (Preserve route and relative sequence)-The solver must
always assign the order to the preassigned route and at the
preassigned relative sequence during the solve operation. If this
assignment rule can’t be followed, it results in an order
violation. With this setting, only the relative sequence is
maintained, not the absolute sequence. To illustrate what this
means, imagine there are two orders: A and B. They have sequence
values of 2 and 3, respectively. If you set their AssignmentRule
field values to Preserve route and relative sequence, A and B’s
actual sequence values may change after solving because other
orders, breaks, and depot visits could still be sequenced before,
between, or after A and B. However, B cannot be sequenced before

What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach an order from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an order and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the order, you would choose 1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States but 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom.

<p>Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile
device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing

pedestrian or a vehicle.</p>
<p>Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the
wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection
or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool
determine on which side of the street the point is.
For more information, see the Bearing and Bearing Tolerance Help topic (<a class="reference external" href="http://links.esri.com/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance">http://links.esri.com/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance</a>). BearingTol: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable
bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the
Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the
range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing
tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location
there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is
evaluated.</p>
<p>The units are in degrees and the default value is 30.
Values must be greater than zero and less than 180.</p>
<p class="last">A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to
add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing

<dt>ArriveDepartDelay: This field stores the amount of travel time needed to</dt>
<dd><p class="first">accelerate the vehicle to normal travel speeds, decelerate it to a
stop, and move it off and on the network (for example, in and out
of parking). By including an ArriveDepartDelay value, the VRP
solver is deterred from sending many routes to service physically
coincident orders.</p>
<p>The cost for this property is incurred between visits to
noncoincident orders, depots, and route renewals. For example, when
a route starts from a depot and visits the first order, the total
arrive/depart delay is added to the travel time. The same is true
when traveling from the first order to the second order. If the
second and third orders are coincident, the ArriveDepartDelay value
is not added between them since the vehicle doesn’t need to move.
If the route travels to a route renewal, the value is added to the
travel time again.</p>
<p>Although a vehicle needs to slow down and stop for a break
and accelerate afterwards, the VRP solver cannot add the
ArriveDepartDelay value for breaks. This means that if a route
leaves an order, stops for a break, and continues to the next
order, the arrive/depart delay is added only once, not
twice.</p>
<p>To illustrate, assume there are five coincident orders in
a high-rise building, and they are serviced by three different
routes. This means three arrive/depart delays would be incurred;
that is, three drivers would need to separately find parking places
and enter the same building. However, if the orders could be
serviced by just one route instead, only one driver would need to
park and enter the building-only one arrive/depart delay would be
incurred. Since the VRP solver tries to minimize cost, it will try
to limit the arrive/depart delays and thus choose the single-route
option. (Note that multiple routes may need to be sent when other
constraints-such as specialties, time windows, or
capacities-require it.)
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. Capacities: The maximum capacity of the vehicle. You can specify
capacity in any dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or
quantity. You can even specify multiple dimensions, for example,
weight and volume.</p>
<p>Enter capacities without indicating units. For example,
assume your vehicle can carry a maximum of 40,000 pounds; you would
enter 40000. You need to remember for future reference that the
value is in pounds.</p>
<p>If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate the
numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording
both weight and volume and your vehicle can carry a maximum weight
of 40,000 pounds and a maximum volume of 2,000 cubic feet,
Capacities should be entered as 40000 2000. Again, you need to
remember the units. You also need to remember the sequence in which the
values and their corresponding units are entered (pounds
followed by cubic feet in this case).</p>
<p>Remembering the units and the unit sequence is important
for a couple of reasons: one, so you can reinterpret the
information later; two, so you can properly enter values for the
DeliveryQuantities and PickupQuantities fields for the orders. To
elaborate on the second point, note that the VRP solver
simultaneously refers to Capacities, DeliveryQuantities, and
PickupQuantities to make sure that a route doesn’t become
overloaded. Since units can’t be entered in the field, the VRP tool can’t make unit conversions, so you need to enter the
values for the three fields using the same units and the same unit
sequence to ensure the values are correctly interpreted. If you mix
units or change the sequence in any of the three fields, you will
get unwanted results without receiving any warning messages. Thus,
it is a good idea to set up a unit and unit-sequence standard
beforehand and continually refer to it whenever entering values for
these three fields.</p>
<p>An empty string or null value is equivalent to all values
being zero. Capacity values can’t be negative.</p>
<p>If the Capacities string has an insufficient number of
values in relation to the DeliveryQuantities or PickupQuantities
fields for orders, the remaining values are treated as
zero.</p>
<p class="last">The VRP solver only performs a simple Boolean test to
determine whether capacities are exceeded. If a route’s capacity
value is greater than or equal to the total quantity being carried,
the VRP solver will assume the cargo fits in the vehicle. This
could be incorrect, depending on the actual shape of the cargo and
the vehicle. For example, the VRP solver allows you to fit a
1,000-cubic-foot sphere into a 1,000-cubic-foot truck that is 8
feet wide. In reality, however, since the sphere is 12.6 feet in
diameter, it won’t fit in the 8-foot wide truck.</p>

Minutes, and MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks has a value of 120, the
driver will get a break after two hours of driving. To assign a
second break after two more hours of driving, the second break’s
MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks property should be 120.</p>
<p>If this field has a value, TimeWindowStart, TimeWindowEnd,
MaxViolationTime, and MaxCumulWorkTime must be null for an analysis
to solve successfully.
The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. MaxCumulWorkTime:</p>
<p>The maximum amount of work time that can be accumulated
before the break is taken. Work time is always accumulated from the
beginning of the route.</p>
<p>Work time is the sum of travel time and service times at
orders, depots, and breaks. Note, however, that this excludes wait
time, which is the time a route (or driver) spends waiting at an
order or depot for a time window to begin.</p>
<p>This field is designed to limit how long a person can work
until a break is required. For instance, if the time_units
parameter is set to Minutes,
MaxCumulWorkTime has a value of 120, and ServiceTime has a value of
15, the driver will get a 15-minute break after two hours of
work.</p>
<p>Continuing with the last example, assume a second break is
needed after three more hours of work. To specify this break, you
would enter 315 (five hours and 15 minutes) as the second break’s
MaxCumulWorkTime value. This number includes the MaxCumulWorkTime
and ServiceTime values of the preceding break, along with the three
additional hours of work time before granting the second break. To
avoid taking maximum-work-time breaks prematurely, remember that
they accumulate work time from the beginning of the route and that
work time includes the service time at previously visited depots,
orders, and breaks.</p>

<div><p>reload or unload the cargo they are delivering or picking up.
Specifically, a route renewal links a route to a depot. The
relationship indicates the route can renew (reload or unload while
en route) at the associated depot.</p>
<p>Route renewals can be used to model scenarios in which a
vehicle picks up a full load of deliveries at the starting depot,
services the orders, returns to the depot to renew its load of
deliveries, and continues servicing more orders. For example, in
propane gas delivery, the vehicle may make several deliveries until
its tank is nearly or completely depleted, visit a refueling point,
and make more deliveries.</p>
<p>Here are a few rules and options to consider when also
working with route seed points:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>The reload/unload point, or renewal location, can be
different from the start or end depot.</p>
<p>Each route can have one or many predetermined renewal

route.</p>
<p>In some cases where there may be several potential renewal
locations for a route, the closest available renewal location is
chosen by the solver.</p>

minimize delivery time. These related orders can be assigned to the

<dt>MaxTransitTime: The maximum transit time for the pair. The transit time is</dt>

The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.
Excess transit time (measured with respect to the direct

you can choose from.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>High-The solver tries to find a solution with the least
excess transit time between paired orders at the expense of
increasing the overall travel costs. It makes sense to use this
setting if you are transporting people between paired orders and
you want to shorten their ride time. This is characteristic of taxi
services.</p>
<p>Medium-This is the default setting. The solver looks for
a balance between reducing excess transit time and reducing the
overall solution cost.</p>
<p>Low-The solver tries to find a solution that minimizes
overall solution cost, regardless of excess transit time. This
setting is commonly used with courier services. Since couriers
transport packages as opposed to people, they don’t need to worry
about ride time. Using Low allows the couriers to service paired
orders in the proper sequence and minimize the overall solution
cost.</p>

<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>ParameterValue: The value for ParameterName used by the tool</dt>
<dd><p class="first">when evaluating the restriction.</p>
<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the
Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each
restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PROHIBITED (-1)-Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
prohibited.</p>
<p>AVOID_HIGH (5)-It
is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2)-It
is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are
associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_LOW (1.3)-It
is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_LOW (0.8)-It
is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5)-It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2)-It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the

<dt>time_zone_usage_for_time_fields: Time Zone Usage for Time Fields (str). Optional parameter. Specifies the time zone for the input date-time fields supported by the tool. This parameter specifies the time zone           for the following fields: TimeWindowStart1, TimeWindowEnd1, TimeWindowStart2, TimeWindowEnd2, InboundArriveTime, and OutboundDepartTime on orders. TimeWindowStart1, TimeWindowEnd1, TimeWindowStart2, and         TimeWindowEnd2 on depots. EarliestStartTime and LatestStartTime on routes. TimeWindowStart and TimeWindowEnd on breaks. GEO_LOCAL — The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the           time zone in which the orders and depots are located. For routes, the date-time values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a                 starting depot, all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is                located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as          8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time. UTC — The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone in which          the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and                      TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 12:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. eastern standard time assuming the eastern standard time is obeying the daylight saving time.                 Specifying the date-time values in UTC is useful if you do not know the time zone in which the orders or depots are located or when you have orders and depots in multiple time zones, and you want all            the date-time values to start simultaneously. The UTC option is applicable only when your network dataset defines a time zone attribute. Otherwise, all the date-time values are always treated as                 GEO_LOCAL. </dt>

<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>When specifying the incidents, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using attributes. The incidents can be specified with the following attributes:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Name-The name of the incident. The name is used in the driving
directions. If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed
with Location is automatically generated in the output routes and
directions.
ID-A unique identifier for the incident. The identifier is included in the output routes (as the IncidentID field) and can help join additional information from the output routes, such as the total travel time or total distance, to attributes from your incidents or vice versa. If the ID isn’t specified, the service autogenerates a unique identifier for each incident.  AdditionalTime-The amount of time spent at the incident, which is added to the total time of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement units are time based. The default value is 0. If you are finding the closest fire stations from fire incidents to estimate response times, the AdditionalTime attribute can store the amount of time it takes firefighters to hook up their equipment at the location of the incident before they can begin fighting the fire.  AdditionalDistance-The extra distance traveled at the incident, which is added to the total distance of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement units are distance based. The default value is 0. Generally, the location of an incident, such as a home, isn’t exactly on the streets; it is set back somewhat from the road. This attribute value can be used to model the distance between the actual incident location and its location on the street, if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance.
CurbApproach-Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart
from the incident. The field value is specified as one of the
following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
0 (Either side of vehicle)-The vehicle can approach and depart the incident in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the incident. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and practical for your vehicle to turn around at the incident. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the incident has a parking lot where vehicles can pull in and turn around. 1 ( Right side of vehicle)-When the vehicle approaches and departs the incident, the incident must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the right-hand side.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>2 (Left side of vehicle)-When the vehicle approaches and departs
the incident, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A
U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>3 (No U-Turn)-When
the vehicle approaches the incident, the curb can be on either side
of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning
around.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The CurbApproach property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an incident on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach an incident from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an incident and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, you would choose Right side of vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>

If the ID isn’t specified, the service autogenerates a unique identifier for each facility.  AdditionalTime-The amount of time spent at the facility, which is added to the total time of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement units are time based. The default value is 0.
If you are finding the closest fire stations to fire incidents, AdditionalTime can store the
time it tends to takes a crew to don the appropriate protective equipment
and exit the fire station.
AdditionalDistance-The extra distance traveled at the facility, which is added to the total distance of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement units are distance based. The default value is 0. Generally the location of a facility, such as a fire station, isn’t exactly on a street; it is set back somewhat from the road. AdditionalDistance can model the distance between the actual facility location and its location on the street, if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance.
CurbApproach:  Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart
from the facility. The field value is specified as one of the
following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
0 (Either side of vehicle)-The vehicle can approach and depart the facility in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the facility. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and practical for your vehicle to turn around at the facility. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the facility has a parking lot where vehicles can pull in and turn around.  1 (Right side of vehicle)-When the vehicle approaches and departs the facility, the facility must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the right-hand side.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>2 (Left side of vehicle)-When the vehicle approaches and departs
the facility, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A
U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>3 (No U-Turn)-When
the vehicle approaches the facility, the curb can be on either side
of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning
around.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The CurbApproach property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach a facility from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, you would choose Right side of vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Using one of the parameter values can find different
facilities as the travel time along some streets may vary based on
the travel direction and one-way restrictions. For instance, a
facility may be a 10-minute drive from the incident while traveling
from the incident to the facility, but while traveling from the
facility to the incident, it may be a 15-minute journey because of
different travel time in that direction. If you are setting a value for Time of Day, traffic may also cause the Facility to Incident and Incident to Facility options to return different results.</p>
<p>Fire departments commonly use the Facility to Incident
value for the parameter since they are concerned with the time it
takes to travel from the fire station (facility) to the location of
the emergency (incident). A retail store (facility) is more
concerned with the time it takes the shoppers (incidents) to reach

<div><p>Checked (True)-Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets (such as
freeways) to lower-order streets (such as local roads), and can be used
to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
true when finding routes to faraway facilities, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.</p>
<p>Unchecked (False)-Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If

For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.

importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the

<div>impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</div></blockquote>
<p>Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<dd><p>The SolveLocationAllocation tool chooses the best location or locations from a set of input locations. Input to this tool includes facilities, which provide goods or services, and demand points, which consume the goods and services. The objective is to find the facilities that supply the demand points most efficiently. The tool solves this problem by analyzing various ways the demand points can be assigned to the different facilities. The solution is the scenario that allocates the most demand to facilities and minimizes overall travel. The output includes the solution facilities, demand points associated with their assigned facilities, and lines connecting demand points to their facilities. The location-allocation tool can be configured to solve specific problem types. Examples include the following: A retail store wants to see which potential store locations would need to be developed to capture 10 percent of the retail market in the area. A fire department wants to determine where it should locate fire stations to reach 90 percent of the community within a four-minute response time. A police department wants to preposition personnel given past criminal activity at night. After a storm, a disaster response agency wants to find the best locations to set up triage facilities, with limited patient capacities, to tend to the affected population.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>

<dt>facilities: Facilities (FeatureSet). Required parameter.  Specify one or more facilities (up to 1,000). The tool chooses the best locations from the set of facilities you specify here.</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div>In a competitive analysis, in which  you try to find the best locations in the face of competition, the facilities of the competitors are specified here as well.</div></blockquote>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>When defining the facilities, you can set properties for each one, such as the facility name or type, by using attributes. Facilities can be specified with the following fields: Name-The name of the facility. The name is included in the name of output allocation lines if the facility is part of the solution.</dt>
<dd><p class="first">FacilityType-Specifies whether the facility is a candidate, required, or competitor facility. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses): 0 (Candidate)-A facility that may be part of the solution. 1 (Required)-A facility that must be part of the solution. 2 (Competitor)-A rival facility that potentially removes demand from your facilities. Competitor facilities are specific to the Maximize Market Share and Target Market Share problem types; they are ignored in other problem types.  Weight-The relative weighting of the facility, which is used to rate the attractiveness, desirability, or bias of one facility compared to another.  For example, a value of 2.0 could capture the preference of customers who prefer, at a ratio of 2 to 1, shopping in one facility over another facility. Factors that potentially affect facility weight include square footage, neighborhood, and age of the building. Weight values other than one are only honored by the maximize market share and target market share problem types; they are ignored in other problem types. Capacity-The  Capacity field is specific to the Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem type; the other problem types ignore this field.  Capacity specifies how much weighted demand the facility is capable of supplying. Excess demand won’t be allocated to a facility even if that demand is within the facility’s default measurement cutoff. Any value assigned to the Capacity field overrides the Default Capacity parameter (Default_Capacity in Python) for the given facility.
CurbApproach-Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at or depart
from the facility. The field value is specified as one of the
following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
0 (Either side of vehicle)-The facility can be visited from either the right or left side of the vehicle.  1 (Right side of vehicle)-Arrive at or depart the facility so that it is on the right side of the vehicle. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the right-hand side so that passengers can disembark at the curb.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><blockquote>
<div>2 (Left side of vehicle)-Arrive at or depart the facility so that it is on the left side of the vehicle. When the vehicle approaches and departs
the facility, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the left-hand side so that passengers can disembark at the curb.</div></blockquote>
<p>The CurbApproach property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach a facility  from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the incident, you would choose Right side of vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>

</dd>
<dt>demand_points: Demand Points (FeatureSet). Required parameter.  Specify one or more demand points (up to 10,000). The tool chooses the best facilities based in large part on how they serve the demand points specified here.   When defining the demand points, you can set properties for each one, such as the demand-point name or weight, by using attributes. Demand points can be specified with the following fields: Name-The name of the demand point. The name is included in the name of an output allocation line or lines if the demand point is part of the solution.  GroupName-The name of the group the demand point is part of. This property is ignored for the maximize capacitated coverage, target market share, and maximize market share problem types. If demand points share a group name, the solver allocates all members of the group to the same facility. (If constraints, such as a cutoff distance, prevent any of the demand points in the group from reaching the same facility, none of the demand points are allocated.) Weight-The relative weighting of the demand point. A value of 2.0 means the demand point is twice as important as one with a weight of 1.0. If demand points represent households, weight could indicate the number of people in each household. Cutoff_Time-The demand point can’t be allocated to a facility that is beyond the travel time indicated here. This field value overrides the value of the Default Measurement Cutoff parameter.  The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is referenced during the analysis only when the measurement units are time based. The default value is null, which means there isn’t an override cutoff. Cutoff_Distance-The demand point can’t be allocated to a facility that is beyond the travel distance indicated here. This field value overrides the value of the Default Measurement Cutoff parameter.  The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is referenced during the analysis only when the measurement units are distance based. The default value is null, which means there isn’t an override cutoff.</dt>

</dd>
<dt>problem_type: Problem Type (str). Optional parameter.  Specifies the objective of the location-allocation analysis. The default objective is to minimize impedance. Minimize Impedance: This is also known as the P-Median problem type. Facilities are located such that the sum of all weighted travel time or distance between demand points and solution facilities is minimized. (Weighted travel is the amount of demand allocated to a facility multiplied by the travel distance or time to the facility.) This problem type is traditionally used to locate warehouses, because it can reduce the overall transportation costs of delivering goods to outlets. Since Minimize Impedance reduces the overall distance the public needs to travel to reach the chosen facilities, the minimize impedance problem without an impedance cutoff is ordinarily regarded as more equitable than other problem types for locating some public-sector facilities such as libraries, regional airports, museums, department of motor vehicles offices, and health clinics.</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div><p>The following list describes how the minimize impedance problem type handles demand: A demand point that cannot reach any facilities, due to setting a cutoff distance or time, is not allocated. A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility. A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only. Maximize Coverage: Facilities are located such that as much demand as possible is allocated to solution facilities within the impedance cutoff. Maximize Coverage is frequently used to locate fire stations, police stations, and ERS centers, because emergency services are often required to arrive at all demand points within a specified response time. Note that it is important for all organizations, and critical for emergency services, to have accurate and precise data so that analysis results correctly model real-world results. Pizza delivery businesses, as opposed to eat-in pizzerias, try to locate stores where they can cover the most people within a certain drive time. People who order pizzas for delivery don’t typically worry about how far away the pizzeria is; they are mainly concerned with the pizza arriving within an advertised time window. Therefore, a pizza-delivery business would subtract pizza-preparation time from their advertised delivery time and solve a maximize coverage problem to choose the candidate facility that would capture the most potential customers in the coverage area. (Potential customers of eat-in pizzerias are more affected by distance, since they need to travel to the restaurant; thus, the attendance maximizing or market share problem types would better suit eat-in restaurants.)
The following list describes how the Maximize Coverage problem handles demand: A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to cutoff distance or time is not allocated. A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility. A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only. Maximize Capacitated Coverage: Facilities are located such that all or the greatest amount of demand can be served without exceeding the capacity of any facility. Maximize Capacitated Coverage behaves like  either the Minimize Impedance or Maximize Coverage problem type but with the added constraint of capacity. You can specify a capacity for an individual facility by assigning a numeric value to  its corresponding Capacity field on the input facilities. If the Capacity field value is null, the facility is assigned a capacity from the Default Capacity property. Use-cases for Maximize Capacitated Coverage include creating territories that encompass a given number of people or businesses, locating hospitals or other medical facilities with a limited number of beds or patients who can be treated, or locating warehouses whose inventory isn’t assumed to be unlimited.
The following list describes how the Maximize Capacitated Coverage problem handles demand: Unlike Maximize Coverage, Maximize Capacitated Coverage doesn’t require a value for the Default Measurement Cutoff; however, when an cutoff is specified, any demand point outside the cutoff time or distance of all facilities is not allocated. An allocated demand point has all or none of its demand weight assigned to a facility; that is, demand isn’t apportioned with this problem type.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If the total demand that can reach a facility is greater than the capacity of the facility, only the demand points that maximize total captured demand and minimize total weighted travel are allocated. You may notice an apparent inefficiency when a demand point is allocated to a facility that isn’t the  nearest solution facility. This may occur when demand points have varying weights and when the demand point in question can reach more than one facility. This kind of result indicates the nearest solution facility didn’t have adequate capacity for the weighted demand, or the most efficient solution for the entire problem required one or more local inefficiencies. In either case, the solution is correct. Minimize Facilities: Facilities are chosen such that as much weighted demand as possible are allocated to solution facilities within the travel time or distance cutoff; additionally, the number of facilities required to cover demand is minimized. Minimize Facilities is the same as Maximize Coverage but with the exception of the number of facilities to locate, which in this case is determined by the solver. When the cost of building facilities is not a limiting factor, the same kinds of organizations that use Maximize Coverage (emergency response, for instance) use Minimize Facilities so that all possible demand points will be covered.</div></blockquote>
<p>The following list describes how the Minimize Facilities problem handles demand: A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated. A demand point that can only  reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility. A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to the nearest facility only. Maximize Attendance: Facilities are chosen such that as much demand weight as possible is allocated to facilities while assuming the demand weight decreases in relation to the distance between the facility and the demand point. Specialty stores that have little or no competition benefit from this problem type, but it may also be beneficial to general retailers and restaurants that don’t have the data on competitors necessary to perform market share problem types. Some businesses that might benefit from this problem type include coffee shops, fitness centers, dental and medical offices, and electronics stores. Public transit bus stops are often chosen with the help of Maximize Attendance. Maximize Attendance assumes that the farther people have to travel to reach your facility, the less likely they are to use it. This is reflected in how the amount of demand allocated to facilities diminishes with distance.
The following list describes how the Maximize Attendance problem handles demand: A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated. When a demand point can reach a facility, its demand weight is only partially allocated to the facility. The amount allocated decreases as a function of the maximum cutoff distance (or time) and the travel distance (or time) between the facility and the demand point. The weight of a demand point that can reach more than one facility is proportionately allocated to the nearest facility only. Maximize Market Share: A specific number of facilities are chosen such that the allocated demand is maximized in the presence of competitors. The goal is to capture as much of the total market share as possible with a given number of facilities, which you specify. The total market share is the sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. The market share problem types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities’ weight, you also need to know that of your competitors’ facilities. The same types of facilities that use the Maximize Attendance problem type can also use market share problem types given that they have comprehensive information that includes competitor data. Large discount stores typically use  Maximize Market Share to locate a finite set of new stores. The market share problem types use a Huff model, which is also known as a gravity model or spatial interaction.
The following list describes how the Maximize Market Share problem handles demand: A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated. A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility. A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore, the weight is split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities’ attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely proportional to the distance between the facility and demand point. Given equal facility weights, this means more demand weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities.  The total market share, which can be used to calculate the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points. Target Market Share: Target Market Share chooses the minimum number of facilities necessary to capture a specific percentage of the total market share in the presence of competitors. The total market share is the sum of all demand weight for valid demand points. You set the percent of the market share you want to reach and let the solver choose the fewest number of facilities necessary to meet that threshold. The market share problem types require the most data because, along with knowing your own facilities’ weight, you also need to know that of your competitors’ facilities. The same types of facilities that use the Maximize Attendance problem type can also use market share problem types given that they have comprehensive information that includes competitor data. Large discount stores typically use the Target Market Share problem type when they want to know how much expansion would be required to reach a certain level of the market share or see what strategy would be needed just to maintain their current market share given the introduction of new competing facilities. The results often represent what stores would like to do if budgets weren’t a concern. In other cases where budget is a concern, stores revert to the Maximize Market Share problem and simply capture as much of the market share as possible with a limited number of facilities.
The following list describes how the target market share problem handles demand: The total market share, which is used in calculating the captured market share, is the sum of the weight of all valid demand points. A demand point that cannot reach any facilities due to a cutoff distance or time is not allocated. A demand point that can only reach one facility has all its demand weight allocated to that facility. A demand point that can reach two or more facilities has all its demand weight allocated to them; furthermore, the weight is split among the facilities proportionally to the facilities’ attractiveness (facility weight) and inversely proportional to the distance between the facility and demand point. Given equal facility weights, this means more demand weight is assigned to near facilities than far facilities.</p>

<p>The units for this parameter are the same as those specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The travel time or distance cutoff is measured by the shortest path along roads.  This property might be used to model the maximum distance that people are willing to travel to visit stores or the maximum time that is permitted for a fire department to reach anyone in the community. Note that demand points have Cutoff_Time and  Cutoff_Distance fields, which, if set accordingly, overrides the Default Measurement Cutoff parameter. You might find that people in rural areas are willing to travel up to 10 miles to reach a facility while urbanites are only willing to travel up to two miles. Assuming Measurement Units is set to Miles, you can model this behavior by setting the default measurement cutoff to 10 and the Cutoff_Distance field value of the demand points in urban areas to 2.</p>

<dt>measurement_transformation_model: Measurement Transformation Model (str). Optional parameter.  This sets the equation for transforming the network cost between facilities and demand points. This property, coupled with the Impedance Parameter, specifies how severely the network impedance between facilities and demand points influences the solver’s choice of facilities. In the following list of transformation options, d refers to demand points and f, facilities. “Impedance” refers to the shortest travel distance or time between two locations. So impedancedf is the shortest-path (time or distance) between demand point d and facility f, and costdf is the transformed travel time or distance between the facility and demand point. Lambda (λ) denotes the impedance parameter. The Measurement Units setting determines whether travel time or distance is analyzed. Linear: costdf = λ * impedancedf The transformed travel time or distance between the facility and the demand point is the same as the time or distance of the shortest path between the two locations. With this option, the impedance parameter (λ) is always set to one. This is the default. Power: costdf = impedancedfλ The transformed travel time or distance between the facility and the demand point is equal to the time or distance of the shortest path raised to the power specified by the impedance parameter (λ). Use the Power option with a positive impedance parameter to specify higher weight to nearby facilities.  Exponential: costdf = e(λ * impedancedf) The transformed travel time or distance between the facility and the demand point is equal to the mathematical constant e raised to the power specified by the shortest-path network impedance multiplied with the impedance parameter (λ). Use the Exponential  option with a positive impedance parameter to specify a high weight to nearby facilities.</dt>

<p>Travel times and distances may change based on direction of travel. If going from point A to point B, you may encounter less traffic or have a shorter path, due to one-way streets and turn restrictions, than if you were traveling in the opposite direction. For instance, going from point A to point B may only take 10 minutes, but going the other direction may take 15 minutes. These differing measurements may affect whether demand points can be assigned to certain facilities because of cutoffs or, in problem types where demand is apportioned, affect how much demand is captured. Fire departments commonly measure from facilities to demand points since they are concerned with the time it takes to travel from the fire station to the location of the emergency. A retail store is more concerned with the time it takes shoppers to reach the store; therefore, stores commonly measure from demand points to facilities. Travel Direction also determines the meaning of any start time that is provided. See the Time of Day parameter for more information.</p>

<dd>Traffic constantly changes in reality, and as it changes, travel times between facilities and demand points also fluctuate.

<p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2)-It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads

</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<div>impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</div></blockquote>
<p>Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<dd><p>The GenerateOriginDestinationCostMatrix tool creates an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations. An OD cost matrix is a table that contains the travel time and travel distance from each origin to each destination. Additionally, it ranks the destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum time or distance required to travel from that origin to each destination. The best path on the street network is discovered for each origin-destination pair, and the travel times and travel distances are stored as attributes of the output lines. Even though the lines are straight for performance reasons, they always store the travel time and travel distance along the street network, not straight-line distance.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>origins: Origins (FeatureSet). Required parameter.  Specify locations that function as starting points in generating the paths to destinations. You can add up to 200 origins.</dt>
<dd><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>When specifying the origins, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or the number of destinations to find from the origin, by using attributes. The origins can be specified with the following attributes</dt>
<dd>Name-The name of the origin. The name can be an unique identifier for the origin. The name is included in the output lines (as the OriginName field) and in the output origins (as the Name field) and can be used to join additional information from the tool outputs to the attributes of your origins.</dd>
<dt>If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed with Location is automatically generated in the output origins. An auto-generated origin name is not included in the output lines.  TargetDestinationCount-The maximum number of destinations that must be found for the origin. If a value is not specified, the value from the Number of Destinations to Find parameter is used. Cutoff-Specify the travel time or travel distance value at which to stop searching for destinations from the origin. Any destination beyond the cutoff value will not be considered.  The value needs to be in the units specified by the Time Units parameter if the impedance attribute in your travel mode is time based or in the units specified by the Distance Units parameter if the impedance attribute in your travel mode is distance based. If a value is not specified, the value from the Cutoff parameter is used.</dt>
<dd>CurbApproach-Specifies the direction a vehicle may depart from the origin. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
0 (Either side of vehicle)-The vehicle can depart the origin in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the origin. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and practical for your vehicle to turn around at the origin. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the origin has a parking lot where vehicles can enter and turn around. 1 ( Right side of vehicle)-When the vehicle departs the origin, the origin must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must depart from the bus stop on the right-hand side. 2 (Left side of vehicle)-When the vehicle departs the origin, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must depart from the bus stop on the left-hand side. 3 (No U-Turn)-For this tool, the No U-turn (3) value functions the same as Either side of vehicle. The CurbApproach property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an origin on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to depart the origin from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to depart from an origin and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the origin, you would choose Right side of vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</dd>

<dt>restrictions: Restrictions (str). Optional parameter.  Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads to be prohibited, but they can also cause them to be avoided or preferred. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit a stop. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so. The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div><blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div>Some restrictions require an additional value to be
specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.</div></blockquote>
<p>Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below. Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.</p>

<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the
Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each
restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PROHIBITED (-1)-Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
prohibited.</p>
<p>AVOID_HIGH (5)-It
is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2)-It

<p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5)-It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2)-It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div><blockquote>
<div>impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</div></blockquote>
<p>Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. This is the default value. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<dd><p>FindRoutes determines the shortest paths to visit the input stops and returns the driving directions, information about the visited stops, and the route paths, including travel time and distance. The tool is capable of finding routes that visit several input stops in a sequence you predetermine or in the  sequence that minimizes overall travel. You can group the input stops into different routes using the RouteName field, and the tool will output one route for each group of stops, allowing you to generate routes for many vehicles in a single solve operation. When using FindRoutes to route multiple vehicles, you need to assign stops to routes before solving. If you need a tool that determines the best way to divide stops among different vehicles, and then route the vehicles, use the SolveVehicleRoutingProblem tool instead.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>stops: Stops (FeatureSet). Required parameter.  Specify two or more stops to route between. You can add up to</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div>10,000 stops and assign up to 150 stops to a single route. (Assign stops to routes using the RouteName attribute.)</div></blockquote>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>When specifying the stops, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using attributes. The stops can be specified with the following attributes:</dt>
<dd>Name-The name of the stop. The name is used in the driving
directions. If the name is not specified, a unique name prefixed
with Location is automatically generated in the output stops, routes, and
directions.</dd>
<dt>RouteName-The name of the route to which the stop is assigned. Assigning the same route name to different stops causes those stops to be grouped together and visited by the same route. You can generate many routes in a single solve by assigning unique route names to different groups of stops. With this tool you can group up to 150 stops into one route. Sequence-The output routes will visit the stops in the order you specify with this attribute. Within a group of stops that have the same RouteName value, the sequence number should be greater than 0 but not greater than the total number of stops. Also, the sequence number should not be duplicated.  If Reorder Stops To Find Optimal Routes is checked (True), all but possibly the first and last sequence values for each route name are ignored so the tool can find the sequence that minimizes overall travel for each route. (The settings for Preserve Ordering of Stops and Return to Start determine whether the first or last sequence values for each route are ignored.) AdditionalTime-The amount of time spent at the stop, which is added to the total time of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement units are time based. The default value is 0.  You can account for the extra time it takes at the stop to complete a task, such as to repair an appliance, deliver a package, or inspect the premises. AdditionalDistance-The extra distance traveled at the stops, which is added to the total distance of the route. The units for this attribute value are specified by the Measurement Units parameter. The attribute value is included in the analysis only when the measurement units are distance based. The default value is 0. Generally, the location of a stop, such as a home, isn’t exactly on the streets; it is set back somewhat from the road. This attribute value can be used to model the distance between the actual stop location and its location on the street, if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance. TimeWindowStart-The earliest time the stop can be visited. Make sure you specify the value as a date and time value, such as 8/12/2015 12:15 PM. By specifying a start and end time for a stop’s time window, you are defining when a route should visit the stop. As long as Use Time Windows is checked and you’ve chosen a time-based unit for Measurement Units, the tool will try to find a solution that minimizes overall travel and reaches the stop within the prescribed time window.  When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, time-window values refer to the time zone in which the stop is located.</dt>
<dd>This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates a route can arrive at any time before the time indicated in the TimeWindowEnd attribute. If a null value is also present in TimeWindowEnd, a route can visit the stop at any time.</dd>
<dt>TimeWindowEnd-The latest time the stop can be visited. Make sure you specify the value as a date and time value, such as 8/12/2015 12:15 PM. By specifying a start and end time for a stop’s time window, you are defining when a route should visit the stop. As long as Use Time Windows is checked and you’ve chosen a time-based unit for Measurement Units, the tool will try to find a solution that minimizes overall travel and reaches the stop within the prescribed time window.  When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, time-window values refer to the time zone in which the stop is located.</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This field can contain a null value; a null value
indicates a route can arrive at any time after the time indicated in the TimeWindowStart attribute. If a null value is also present in TimeWindowStart, a route can visit the stop at any time.</p>
<p>CurbApproach-Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart
from the stop. The field value is specified as one of the
following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
0 (Either side of vehicle)-The vehicle can approach and depart the stop in either direction, so a U-turn is allowed at the stop. This setting can be chosen if it is possible and practical for your vehicle to turn around at the stop. This decision may depend on the width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the stop has a parking lot where vehicles can enter and turn around. 1 ( Right side of vehicle)-When the vehicle approaches and departs the stop, the stop must be on the right side of the vehicle. A U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the right-hand side.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>2 (Left side of vehicle)-When the vehicle approaches and departs
the stop, the curb must be on the left side of the vehicle. A
U-turn is prohibited. This is typically used for vehicles such as buses that must arrive with the bus stop on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>3 (No U-Turn)-When
the vehicle approaches the stop, the curb can be on either side
of the vehicle; however, the vehicle must depart without turning
around.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The CurbApproach property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a stop on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach a stop from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a stop and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the stop, you would choose Right side of vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p class="last">The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.

<div>impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</div></blockquote>
<p>Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. This is the default value. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>

<dd><p>GenerateServiceAreas determines network service areas around facilities. A network service area is a region that encompasses all streets that can be accessed within a given distance or travel time from one or more facilities. For instance, the 10-minute service area for a facility includes all the streets that can be reached within 10 minutes from that facility. Service areas are commonly used to visualize and measure accessibility. For example, a three-minute drive-time polygon around a grocery store can determine which residents are able to reach the store within three minutes and are thus more likely to shop there.</p>

<p>Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the
Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is applicable only
if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
Restrictions parameter.</p>
<p>In Attribute Parameter Values, each
restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field
value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of
the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
listed within the parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PROHIBITED (-1)-Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
prohibited.</p>
<p>AVOID_HIGH (5)-It
is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>AVOID_MEDIUM (2)-It
is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are

<p>AVOID_LOW (1.3)-It

<p>PREFER_LOW (0.8)-It

<p>PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5)-It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
are associated with the restriction.</p>
<p>PREFER_HIGH (0.2)-It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
that are associated with the restriction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
associated with the restriction.</p>

<dt>Geographically Local: The Time of Day parameter refers to the time zone or zones in which the facilities are located. Therefore, the start or end times of the service areas are staggered by time zone. Setting Time of Day to 9:00 a.m., choosing geographically local for Time Zone for Time of Day, and solving causes service areas to be generated for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time for any facilities in the Eastern Time Zone, 9:00 a.m. Central Time for facilities in the Central Time Zone, 9:00 a.m. Mountain Time for facilities in the Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. If stores in a chain that span the U.S. open at 9:00 a.m. local time, this parameter value could be chosen to find market territories at opening time for all stores in one solve. First, the stores in the Eastern Time Zone open and a polygon is generated, then an hour later stores open in Central Time, and so on. Nine o’clock is always in local time but staggered in real time. UTC: The Time of Day parameter refers to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Therefore, all facilities are reached or departed from simultaneously, regardless of the time zone each is in. Setting Time of Day to 2:00 p.m., choosing UTC, then solving causes service areas to be generated for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time for any facilities in the Eastern Time Zone, 8:00 a.m. Central Standard Time for facilities in the Central Time Zone, 7:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time for facilities in the Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. The scenario above assumes standard time. During daylight saving time, the Eastern, Central, and Mountain Times would each be one hour ahead (that is, 10:00, 9:00, and 8:00 a.m., respectively). One of the cases in which the UTC option is useful is to visualize emergency-response coverage for a jurisdiction that is split into two time zones. The emergency vehicles are loaded as facilities. Time of Day is set to now in UTC. (You need to determine what  the current time and date are  in terms of UTC to correctly use this option.) Other properties are set and the analysis is solved. Even though a time-zone boundary divides the vehicles, the results show areas that can be reached given current traffic conditions. This same process  can be used for other times as well, not just for now.</dt>

<dt>travel_mode: Travel Mode (str). Optional parameter.  Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your</dt>
<dd><p class="first">organization to better reflect your organization’s workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your organization.</p>
<p>To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.</p>
<p class="last">The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.
Once you have identified the analysis settings, you should work with your organization’s administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing travel mode so that
everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.</p>

<dt>impedance: Impedance (str). Optional parameter.  Specify the</dt>
<dd><blockquote class="first">
<div><blockquote>
<div>impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.</div></blockquote>
<p>Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car. (What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don’t fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.</p>
